All of Dougie's public vibe coding experiments!

## UPDATE: November 25th 2025:
This project is a full suite of custom 2D and 3D games that I built from scratch. It includes a 3D world builder, several first-person experiences, and modern takes on classic arcade mechanics. Each game has its own physics, visuals, and upgrade systems. The collection is designed to show how far you can push creative coding across different styles of gameplay.

On the 3D side, you can build entire worlds using a large model library, then explore them in first person. There’s also a block-style shooter with multiple weapons and enemy types, along with a space dogfighting game that uses real physics, barrel rolls, pickups, and boss encounters.

The 2D set takes familiar classics and levels them up with effects, power-ups, and new mechanics. You’ll find a modern Space Invaders, a TRON-style light-trail combat game, a power-packed Pong remake, a tower-defense challenge, an upgraded minesweeper, and a psychedelic take on Snake.

The goal was to experiment across genres and show how varied gameplay systems can live together in one cohesive project.
