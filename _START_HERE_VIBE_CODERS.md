## 🚀 Getting Set Up (One-Time Setup)

### Step 1: Download an AI-Powered Code Editor

You'll need a code editor with a built-in AI chatbot. Pick one:

| Editor          | Link                                   | Notes                             |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Antigravity** | [Download](https://antigravity.google) | Made by Google, new and powerful  |
| **Cursor**      | [Download](https://cursor.com)         | Very popular, great for beginners |

Install it like any other app!

### Step 2: Create Your Workspace

1. In your file explorer, create a new folder called `my-games` or anything else you want to call it inside of a new (or existing) "Vibe Coding" folder.
2. Open your AI editor and open the folder you just created.

### Step 3: Download the Project

Ask your AI assistant:

> "Clone the GitHub repository https://github.com/wdcampbell3/projectfresh-hub into this folder"

The AI will download all the game code for you. This only takes a minute!

### Step 4: Install the Project

Ask your AI::

> "Install the project dependencies with npm install"

This downloads all the pieces the games need. Wait for it to finish (about 30 seconds).

### Step 5: Start Playing!

Ask your AI:

> "Start the development server with npm run dev"

Then open your browser to **http://localhost:5173** and explore the games! 🎉

## 🎨 Making Your First Tweak

Now for the fun part! Here are some easy things to try:

### Change a Game's Colors

> "In the Pong game, change the paddle color from white to bright green"

### Adjust Difficulty

> "In Space Invaders, make the enemies move 50% faster"

### Add a Power-Up

> "Add a new power-up to Minesweeper that reveals all mines for 2 seconds"

### Change the Landing Page

> "Update the homepage title to say 'Alex's Awesome Arcade'"

### Add a New Game to the Sidebar

> "Make me a game of TikTakToe but add a hidden monster that eats the player's piece when they place it"

...Get as creative as you like!

## � Tips for Talking to Your AI Assistant

### ✅ DO: Be Specific

**Good:** "In the Pong game, make the ball speed increase by 10% each time it hits a paddle"

**Not as good:** "Make Pong harder"

### ✅ DO: Start Small

Instead of asking for a complete new game all at once, build it piece by piece:

1. "Create a basic canvas with a bouncing ball"
2. "Add keyboard controls to move a paddle"
3. "Add collision detection between the ball and paddle"
4. "Add a score counter"

### ✅ DO: Test Often

After each change, refresh your browser to see the result. If something breaks, tell your AI:

> "That change broke the game - I see this error: [paste the error]. Can you fix it?"

### ❌ DON'T: Ask for Too Much at Once

The AI works best with focused requests. Instead of "build me a complete RPG with inventory, combat, and quests," start with one feature at a time.

### ❌ DON'T: Worry About Mistakes

If something goes wrong, you can always ask:

> "Undo the last change you made"

or

> "Reset the file back to how it was before we started"

## 📡 Publishing Online (Optional - Advanced)

Want to share your games with friends? Here's how to put them on the internet!

### Step 1: Create Accounts

You'll need free accounts on:

- **GitHub** - [github.com](https://github.com) (stores your code)
- **Netlify** - [netlify.com](https://netlify.com) (hosts your website)

### Step 2: Push to GitHub

Ask your AI:

> "Help me create a new GitHub repository and push this project to it"

The AI will walk you through:

1. Creating a repository on GitHub
2. Connecting your local code to GitHub
3. Uploading (pushing) your code

### Step 3: Connect to Netlify

1. Log into [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. Click **"Add new site"** → **"Import an existing project"**
3. Choose **GitHub** and select your repository
4. Use these settings:
   - **Build command:** `npm run build`
   - **Publish directory:** `build`
5. Click **Deploy!**

Your games will be live at `https://something-random.netlify.app` in about 2 minutes!

### Custom Domain (Even More Advanced)

Want your own URL like `mygames.com`? Netlify supports custom domains - check their documentation for instructions.

## 🆘 If Something Goes Wrong

### The dev server won't start

Ask your AI: _"The dev server isn't starting. Can you help me troubleshoot?"_

### A game is broken

Ask your AI: _"The [game name] stopped working after we made changes. Can you help fix it?"_

### You want to start over

Ask your AI: _"Reset all my changes and restore the original code from GitHub"_
